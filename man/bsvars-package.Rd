\title{Bayesian Estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressive Models}
\description{
Efficient and fast algorithms for Bayesian estimation of 
Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. 
A wide range of SVAR models is considered, including homo- and heteroskedastic specifications 
and those with non-normal structural shocks. The heteroskedastic SVAR model setup is similar as in 
Woźniak & Droumaguet (2015) <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.19492.55687> and Lütkepohl & Woźniak (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103862>.
The sampler of the structural matrix follows Waggoner & Zha (2003) ,doi:10.1016/S0165-1889(02)00168-9>, 
whereas that for autoregressive parameters follows Chan, Koop, Yu (2022) <https://www.joshuachan.org/papers/OISV.pdf>. 
The specification of Markov switching heteroskedasticity is inspired by Song & Woźniak (2021) <doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.174>,
and that of Stochastic Volatility model by Kastner & Frühwirth-Schnatter (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.01.002>.

\details{
All the SVAR models in this package are specified by two equations, including 
the reduced form equation:
\deqn{Y = AX + E}
where \eqn{Y} is an \code{NxT} matrix of dependent variables, 
\eqn{X} is a \code{KxT} matrix of explanatory variables, 
\eqn{E} is an \code{NxT} matrix of reduced form error terms, 
and \eqn{A} is an \code{NxK} matrix of autoregressive slope coefficients and 
parameters on deterministic terms in \eqn{X}.

The structural equation is given by:
\deqn{BE = U}
where \eqn{U} is an \code{NxT} matrix of structural form error terms, and
\eqn{B} is an \code{NxN} matrix of contemporaneous relationships.

Finally, all of the models share the following assumptions regarding the structural
shocks \code{U}, namely, joint conditional normality given the past observations collected
in matrix \code{X}, and temporal and contemporaneous independence. The latter implies 
zero correlations and autocorrelations. 

The various SVAR models estimated differ by the specification of structural shocks
variances. The different models include:
\itemize{
  \item homoskedastic model with unit variances
  \item heteroskedastic model with stationary Markov switching in the variances
  \item heteroskedastic model with Stochastic Volatility process for variances
  \item non-normal model with a finite mixture of normal components and component-specific variances
  \item heteroskedastic model with sparse Markov switching in the variances where the number of heteroskedastic components is estimated
  \item non-normal model with a sparse mixture of normal components and component-specific variances where the number of heteroskedastic components is estimated

# upload data
data(us_fiscal_lsuw)

# specify the model and set seed
specification  = specify_bsvar_sv$new(us_fiscal_lsuw, p = 4)
set.seed(123)

# run the burn-in
burn_in        = estimate_bsvar_sv(specification, 10)

# estimate the model
posterior      = estimate_bsvar_sv(burn_in$get_last_draw(), 20)

# compute impulse responses 5 years ahead
irf           = compute_impulse_responses(posterior, horizon = 8)

# compute forecast error variance decomposition 5 years ahead
fevd           = compute_variance_decompositions(posterior, horizon = 8)
