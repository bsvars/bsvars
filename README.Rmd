# bsvars

Bayesian Estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressive Models

This package provides efficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A wide range of SVAR models is considered, including homo- and heteroskedastic specifications and those with non-normal structural shocks.

# Installation

Just open your **R** and type:
```
install.packages("bsvars")
```

The package is under intensive development. To the the newest changes install it by typing:
```
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/bsvars/bsvars.git")
```

# Start your Bayesian analysis of data

The beginnings are as easy as ABC:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# upload the package
library(bsvars)

# upload data
data(us_fiscal_lsuw)
 
# specify the model and set seed
specification  = specify_bsvar_sv$new(us_fiscal_lsuw, p = 4)
set.seed(123)
 
# run the burn-in
burn_in        = estimate(1000, specification)

# estimate the model
posterior      = estimate(50000, burn_in$get_last_draw(), thin = 10)

# Now, you're ready to analyse your model!
```

Starting from **bsvars** version 2.0.0 a simplified workflow using the `|>` is possible:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(bsvars)
set.seed(123)
us_fiscal_lsuw |>
  specify_bsvar_sv$new(p = 4) |>
  estimate(S = 1000) |> 
  estimate(S = 50000) |> 
  compute_impulse_responses(horizon = 8) -> irfs
```

# Progress bar

MCMCs for multivariate dynamic structural models might take a while to run. **bsvars** relies on efficient algorithms and fast codes developed using **cpp** code via **Rcpp** and **RcppArmadillo** packages to cut the time of computations by orders of magnitude. Still, while waiting these a few minutes, you can track the progress by looking at the beautiful progress bar:
